# Repeater

The trickiest part of making a repeating tile from an image of a pattern is getting the edges to wrap nicely. Repeater helps with this by displaying the tiled result as you crop, so you can easily spot where to adjust the crop dimensions.

This project was built using the older Grunt version of [Yeoman Webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp) - here's the [legacy repo branch with the documentation](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp/tree/legacy-grunt).

## Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Install Grunt and Bower globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`
3. Install npm and bower modules with `npm install && bower install`
4. Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` to develop. `--allow-remote` option for remote access.
